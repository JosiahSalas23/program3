IglooScore1 bugs

In the function overallScore()

under the if(score1 < score2)
I changed the code from 
s = score2; 
to
s = score1;
so it can calculate the right score

under the else condition
I change the code from 
s = score1;
to 
s = score2; 
so it can calculate the right score
 
In the main function
You do not check if the scores are at or between 0 and 50.
Right now the user can input negative values or scores higher than 50

IglooScore2 bugs

In the function overallScore()

under the else if (score2 < score1 && score2 < score3)
I changed the code from
s1 = score1;
s2 = score2;
to
s1 = score1;
s2 = score3;
so it can calculate the right score

under the else condition
I change the code from
s1 = 99;
s2 = 99;
to
s1 = score1;
s2 = score2;
so it can calculate the right score

In the main function
There is no way to test if the String args[] == null in java.
So I removed (args == null) since its imposible to test and args.Length != 3 already takes care of that.
